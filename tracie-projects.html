            <p class="project-description">
        For this project, I designed a music dashboard that reports user behaviors and interactions within a music app. The dashboard highlights key insights such as the average listening time, favorite singers, and most-played albums, giving a clear picture of how users engage with the app.
        <br>The process began with research and the creation of a persona map to better understand the needs and goals of the target audience. From there, I sketched out initial layouts and refined the design through multiple iterations. The visual design and graphics were developed primarily in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, where I focused on creating a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface.
        <br>This project allowed me to combine user research with visual storytelling, turning data into an engaging experience that communicates user behavior in a clear and visually appealing way.
